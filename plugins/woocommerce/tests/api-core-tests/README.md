# WooCommerce Core API Test Suite

This package contains automated API tests for WooCommerce, based on Playwright and `wp-env`. It supersedes the SuperTest based [api-core-tests package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@woocommerce/api-core-tests) and e2e-environment [setup](../tests/e2e), which we will gradually deprecate.

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js ([Installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- NVM ([Installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- PNPM ([Installation instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- Docker and Docker Compose ([Installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/))

Note, that if you are on Mac and you install Docker through other methods such as homebrew, for example, your steps to set it up might be different. The commands listed in steps below may also vary.

If you are using Windows, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for running tests. Follow the [WSL Setup Instructions](../tests/e2e/WSL_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) first before proceeding with the steps below.

### Introduction

WooCommerce's `api-core-tests` are powered by Playwright. The test site is spun up using `wp-env` (recommended), but we will continue to support `e2e-environment` in the meantime.

**Running tests for the first time:**

- `nvm use`
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run build --filter=woocommerce`
- `cd plugins/woocommerce`
- `pnpm env:test`
- `pnpm test:api-pw`

To run the test again, re-create the environment to start with a fresh state 

- `pnpm env:destroy`
- `pnpm env:test`
- `pnpm test:api-pw`

Other ways of running tests:

- `pnpm test:api-pw --debug` (debug)
- `pnpm test:api-pw ./tests/api-core-tests/tests/hello/hello.test.js` (running a single test)

To see all options, run `cd plugins/woocommerce && pnpm playwright test --help`

## Environment variables

The following environment variables can be configured as shown in `.env.example`:

```
# Your site's base URL, not including a trailing slash
BASE_URL="https://mysite.com"

# The admin user's username or generated consumer key
USER_KEY=""

# The admin user's password or generated consumer secret
USER_SECRET=""
```

For local setup, create a `.env` file in the `woocommerce/plugins/woocommerce/tests/api-core-tests` folder with the three required values described above. If any of these variables are configured they will override the values automatically set in the `playwright.config.js`

When using a username and password combination instead of a consumer secret and consumer key, make sure to have the [JSON Basic Authentication plugin](https://github.com/WP-API/Basic-Auth) installed and activated on the test site.

For more information about authentication with the WooCommerce API, please see the [Authentication](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/?javascript#authentication) section in the WooCommerce REST API documentation.

### About the environment

The default values are:

- Latest stable WordPress version
- PHP 7.4
- MariaDB
- URL: `http://localhost:8086/`
- Admin credentials: `admin/password`

If you want to customize these, check the [Test Variables](#test-variables) section.


For more information how to configure the test environment for `wp-env`, please checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/env) documentation.

### Test Variables

The test environment uses the following test variables:

```json
{ 
  "url": "http://localhost:8086/",
  "users": {
    "admin": {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password"
    },
    "customer": {
      "username": "customer",
      "password": "password"
    }
  }
}
```

If you need to modify the port for your local test environment (eg. port is already in use) or use, edit [playwright.config.js](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/e2e/playwright.config.js). Depending on what environment tool you are using, you will need to also edit the respective `.json` file.

**Modify the port wp-env**

Edit [.wp-env.json](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/.wp-env.json) and [playwright.config.js](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/e2e/playwright.config.js).

**Modify port for e2e-environment**

Edit [tests/e2e/config/default.json](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/e2e/config/default.json).****

### Starting/stopping the environment

After you run a test, it's best to restart the environment to start from a fresh state. We are currently working to reset the state more efficiently to avoid the restart being needed, but this is a work-in-progress.

- `pnpm env:down` to stop the environment
- `pnpm env:destroy` when you make changes to `.wp-env.json`
- `pnpm env:test` to spin up the test environment

## Guide for writing tests

When writing new tests, a good source on how to get started is to reference the [existing tests](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/api-core-tests/tests). Data that is required for the tests should be located in an equivalent file in the [data](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/api-core-tests/data) folder.

The [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) is a good source for finding out more details on the various methods used in the tests, including what is available to you when you write new tests. The [API testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-api-testing) section has a good example on how the [playwright.config.js](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/plugins/woocommerce/tests/api-core-tests/playwright.config.js) is used (see [Configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-api-testing#configuration) section) and also how [Setup and Teardown](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-api-testing#setup-and-teardown) works. 

Note: Playwright uses the [expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect) library for test assertions. This library provides a lot of matchers like `toEqual`, `toContain`, `toHaveLength` and many more. Examples of these are throughout the test files.

## What aspects of the API should we test?

Assuming that we have validated the API contract (inspected the spec/contract, made sure the endpoints are correctly named, resources and types reflect the object model and there is no missing/duplicate functionality) we are ready to test. 


For each API request method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`), the test would need to take the following actions: 
1. Verify correct HTTP status code. For example, creating a resource should return 201 CREATED and unpermitted requests should return 403 FORBIDDEN, etc.
2. Verify response payload. Check valid JSON body and correct field names, types, and values â€” including error responses.
3. Verify response headers where appropriate e.g. Some headers hold information related to search totals, pagination values etc. (see [Examples](#examples) below).

At a minimum, we want to ensure each possible CRUD operation can be applied and sufficient assertions have been validated based on the above. 

A reasonable process would be:
1. Create an object using a `POST` request
2. Retrieve the created object using the `GET` request
3. Update the object using a `POST` request
4. Delete the object using a `DELETE`request
5. Test any batch create/update/delete operations (if applicible)

Additional tests can also be added to test the following general test scenarios:

- Basic positive tests (happy paths) - check basic functionality and the acceptance criteria of the API
- Extended positive testing with optional parameters - more thorough testing (can be used for testing a bug/updates/new functionality)
- Negative testing with valid input - expect to gracefully handle problem scenarios with valid user input e.g. trying to add an existing username
- Negative testing with invalid input - expect to gracefully handle problem scenarios with invalid user input e.g. trying to add a username which is null


### Creating test structure

The structure of the test serves as a skeleton for the test itself. 

Each test file requires the `@playwright/test` module to be imported as follows:
```js
const { test, expect } = require( '@playwright/test' );
```
You can create a test by using the `test.describe()` and `test()` methods of Playwright:

- [`test.describe()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-1) - creates a block that groups together several related tests;
- [`test()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-call) - actual method that runs the test.

Based on our example, the test skeleton would look as follows:

```js
test.describe( 'Coupons API tests', () => {
	test( 'can create a coupon', async ( {request} ) => {
    // test to create a coupon here
  } );

	test( 'can retrieve a coupon', async ( {request} ) => {
    // test to retrieve a coupon here
  } );

	test( 'can update a coupon', async ( { request } )  => {
    // test to update a coupon here
  } );
} );
```

Note: you can also nest a `test.describe()` inside a `test.describe()`. Example:

```js
test.describe('Orders API tests: CRUD', () => {
	let orderId; //test variable

	test.describe('Create an order', () => {
		test('can create a pending order by default', async ({request}) => {
      //test code here
    }
```
This allows you to further subgroup tests. When viewing the tests results locally, each test describe 'level' will be separated by `>` in the console as below: 

`Orders API tests: CRUD â€º Create an order â€º can create a pending order by default`

## Test Data Setup/Teardown

You may need test data setup prior to the execution of your tests and removed after the execution of your tests. This can be achieved with 

- [`test.beforeAll()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-before-all) - runs before all the tests in file/group
- [`test.afterAll()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-after-all) - runs after all the tests in file/group
- [`test.beforeEach()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-before-each) - runs before each test in file/group
- [`test.afterEach()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-after-each) - runs after each test in file/group


## Writing the test - a Quick Start Guide

1. Create test.js file inside the tests directory
2. Import [@playwright/test module
3. Group tests with test.describe() methods
4. Add tests with test() methods
5. Separate data where required into files in the data directory 
6. After writing your tests, ensure all tests pass successfully with `pnpm test:api-pw` before commiting to the codebase 


If you have made updates to funcitonality that breaks the tests then then tests should be updated accordingly. Similarly, if there is new functionality added then new tests should be added.

## Debugging tests

When debugging API tests, it is usually simple enough to add `console.log()` statements to output the values of your response/JSON/variables/status etc. Be sure to remove them when done ;)
