### Add Local Pickup shipping method and its blocks. ([7433](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7433))

1. A detailed testing guide exists in [docs/internal-developers/testing/cart-checkout/local-pickup.md](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/blob/b49573b91d37cff511c3fb3288e0458dbf0c582f/docs/internal-developers/testing/cart-checkout/local-pickup.md)

1. Add the **Products** block to a page.
2. Add (or just select if already present) the **Product Title** and **Product Summary** product elements.
3. Make sure the icon color matches the color of the equivalent core blocks (Post Title and Post Summary).

### Ensure the filter controls are consistently displayed in the editor. ([8079](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8079))

1. Create a new post, add the following blocks: Filter by rating, filter by stock, filter by attribute, filter by price, Products (Beta), and publish it.
2. Access the post as a regular customer would. Ensure nothing has changed, and all filters are working as expected.
3. Now edit the post: ensure all components are normally loaded in the editor. When you click on them, ensure that you see the same behavior as demonstrated on this gif (no preloaders should be displayed).

### Convert Add to Cart to TypeScript. ([8077](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8077))

1. Add a “Single Product” block and make sure the “Add to cart” block is there.
2. Go to the front-end
3. Test the functionality of the “Add to cart” button in at least the following scenarios:
	- A normal product, it displays the “Add to cart” text, it can be clicked, switches to a loading state, and then shows the number of items in cart.
	- With a grouped product, it shows the “View products” text and it works like a link instead of a button (also HTML should be a and not button).
	- With an external product (e.g. “WordPress Pennant”) it also acts like a link and displays a different text.
	- With an out of stock product, it doesn't show a button or link, but just an “Out of stock” text.
	- With a variable product, it shows the product selection form elements if the toggle “Display form elements” is enabled, otherwise it shows “View options”.

### Added context for aria-label on cart quantity controls. ([8099](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8099))

1. Add some items to the cart.
2. Using a screen reader, ensure it reads "increase/decrease quantity of " / "remove from your cart" on quantity controls, giving clear instructions on what item the amount on cart is being changed.

### Ensure the Checkout Totals and Checkout Order Summary blocks cannot be removed from the Checkout block. ([7873](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7873))

1. Add the Checkout block to a page and then open the List View in the Gutenberg editor.
2. From the List View select the Checkout Totals Block, ensure you cannot remove it.
3. Try to unlock it and remove it, ensure that this is not possible.
4. Repeat for Checkout Order Summary block.

### Convert sidebar layout component to TypeScript. ([7904](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7904))

1. Add a Cart block to a page, and confirm sidebar is getting displayed properly with different screen sizes.
2. Add a Checkout block to a page, and confirm sidebar is getting displayed properly with different screen sizes.
