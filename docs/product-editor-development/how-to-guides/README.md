# How-to Guides for the Product form

There are several ways to extend and modify the new product form. Below are links to different tutorials.

## Generic fields

One way to extend the new product form is by making use of generic fields. This allows you to easily modify the form using PHP only. We have a wide variety of generic fields that you can use, like a text, checkbox, pricing or a select field. You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/packages/js/product-editor/src/blocks/generic/README.md).

To see how you can make use of these fields you can follow the [generic fields tutorial](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/trunk/docs/product-editor-development/how-to-guides/generic-fields-tutorial.md).

## Writing a custom field

It is also possible to write your own custom field and render those within the product form. This is helpful if the generic fields don't quite fit your use case.
