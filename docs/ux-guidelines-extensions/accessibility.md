It's important to consider accessibility in your WooCommerce Extensions and Themes, creating interfaces that accommodate a range of abilities, ensuring everyone can navigate, understand, and interact with your site effectively.

## Accessibility Guidelines

Your extensions must meet the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)Â (WCAG). Meeting 100% conformance with WCAG 2.0 is hard work; meet the AA level of conformance at a minimum.
