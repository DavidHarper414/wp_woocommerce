Reviews are an integral part of the online shopping experience, and people installing software pay attention to them. Prospective users of your plugins will likely consider average ratings when making software choices.

Many of today’s most popular online review platforms — from Yelp business reviews, to Amazon product reviews — have a range of opinion that can be polarized, with many extremely positive and/or negative reviews, and fewer moderate opinions. This creates a “J-shaped” distribution of reviews that isn’t as accurate or as helpful as could be.

WooCommerce.com and WordPress.org both feature reviews heavily, and competing plugins having a higher rating likely have the edge in user choice. 

## First considerations around reviews

Requesting more reviews for a plugin with major issues will not generate good reviews, and analyzing existing reviews will help surface areas to address before soliciting reviews.

It’s extremely rare for users of WordPress plugins to leave reviews organically (.2% of users for WordPress.org), which means that there’s an untapped market of 99.8% of users of the average plugin.

These plugins are competing with other plugins on the same search terms in the WordPress.org plugin directory, and ratings are a large factor in the ranking algorithm. This is not usually a factor to the same extent on the MP (for instance, our PayPal plugin directly competes on all possible keywords with other PayPal extensions on the WordPress.org repository, while it does not compete with other PayPal payments plugins on the MP.)

## How to request reviews

### Admin notices

Admin notices are industry standard methods of requesting reviews, but bombarding the admin dashboard is not effective. We recommend using restraint in the design of the notice, as well as limiting to a single notice at a time. It’s very easy to overwhelm merchants with too many notices, or too intrusive notices.

#### Recommendations:

* A good place for an admin notice to review a plugin would be to show on the plugin pages and settings pages.
* Have a snooze option (or multiples!) with a clear expectation of when the notice will reappear.
* It needs to always be completely dismissable. It cannot just have a snooze option.
* The options presented in the notice must be phrased carefully to avoid manipulative language in the options.
* Use consistently designed notices, so the request for reviews feels like a part of your plugin, and looks consistent with WooCommerce design.

### Direct contact

#### Recommendations

* The most direct route to requesting reviews with the highest chance of being positive is to contact the customer when they are the happiest with the product.
* This can be milestone or time based, following the timing guidelines below.
* The best method for this is either an email or other direct exchange (support chat, call, etc.). This has the highest conversion rate, especially when timed properly so that the customer is happiest.
* This is also extremely effective when you are able to request feedback from specifically qualified merchants, such as merchants that have processed a certain amount with your platform, or who have shipped their first 100 orders using your fulfillment plugin, or similar.
* Direct outreach is most likely to be successful if you have ways of targeting users for review requests (merchant account / usage info, etc.), as well as ways to gather the reviews, like sales or marketing teams able to email/call/chat with merchants.

## Utilizing your support team

Support is usually the primary contact point of merchants when they reach out. Tickets and chats are the best tools we have to converse with merchants, understand pain-points about our software, listen to their feedback and analyze their feature requests. Collectively, support teams have a great understanding of the products and how people use them. This information is essential to be transferred over to Product and Engineering teams.

* Having a strict internal SLA where support team requests are answered by product or engineering teams.
* Ensure you have a way for support to effectively report bugs.
* When responding to support teams, avoid super-short answers, and try to explain the answer simply and concisely, to allow the support agent to copy/paste to the merchant.
* Avoid replying things like “No, this is not possible” or “No, this feature will not be implemented” without providing additional context about technical or product limitations.
* You can regularly dedicate additional time to implement a short custom snippet or to provide in-depth technical details about how a custom project would be implemented, so that merchants can reach a solution faster if they decide to hire a dedicated WooCommerce developer. A small effort can go a long way to amaze merchants and reveal an opportunity to request a 5 star review.
* Keep support in the loop when they report a bug or request a new feature. When you release a new product version, we always consider the impact it can have on support.  
* Work closely with the support team, for example having a feedback hangout call every month, where you can discuss product feedback and planned improvements.

With these kinds of practices in place, support teams are more willing to share feedback, issues, concerns, and questions with us. This helps maintain a closer relationship with merchants and identify pain-points early, before they become a reason for them to churn.

## Utilizing feature requests

It is important to keep track of all feature requests, and have some sort of system of record where anyone can see what kind of feedback the product is receiving over time. 

We recommend a daily or bi-daily check-in, where you:

* triage new feature requests,
* celebrate positive reviews and;
* act upon negative reviews.


Carefully maintaining feature request boards (or similar system) is key, as the average board contains a lot of duplicate/spam content, requests about features that have been implemented and requests about features that will likely never be implemented. Poorly maintained boards make merchants feel unheard/neglected.

This results in more negative reviews on the premise that the product teams were not reading/listening to their feedback.

We've seen good results with the following procedures:

Starting with the most affected products, go through all open requests, reply to most/all of them and categorize them as:

* “Open”, for requests that we still want more feedback,
* “Planned”, for requests that we plan to implement,
* “Completed”, for requests that have already been implemented and;
* “Closed”, for requests that we do not plan to implement, as they are not a good fit for the product, for duplicate/spam requests and for requests that were actually support questions.

Replying to all “Open” requests is the goal, but if that's not attainable currently, make sure to reply to 100% of the requests that are closed.

For new open requests that arrive as a feature request, discuss/triage them, reply promptly, and assign a status to avoid having the board become unmanaged, and ensure merchants feel (and are) heard. 

Apart from the effect a tidy board has on merchants, it also helps product teams better understand which requests are most wanted and most impactful and then, plan work accordingly.


## Responding to negative reviews

An unpleasant event in the merchant’s journey can lead them to leave a public, negative review. These events usually are:

* a problem with the product,
* a missing product feature,
* an unhelpful reply,
* long wait times to receive a reply,or;
* combinations of the above.

Our goal is always to turn this review around — this sounds tough, but it is really rewarding.

In the majority of cases, merchants who leave a negative review have first tried contacting support for help. This is useful knowledge, as we can read through the conversation history, understand the issue the merchant experienced and share more details with them when we reach out, even from our first reply.

The process we have seen work well is:

* Create a new response (via email, or on a public review) with subject: Regarding your recent review for xxx.
* Start by introducing yourself: Hey there, This is Andrew from the team that develops xxx.
* Use empathetic language and make it clear that this negative review had an impact on us: I read your recent review for xxx and I am worried to hear that an issue is preventing you from using this plugin as you had in mind. I’d be happy to help you resolve this!

Compare the above sentence with: I am sorry to hear that you experienced an issue with xxx. “I am sorry to” indicates that you are saddened by an event, but don’t necessarily plan to do something about it (vs “I am worried to hear”, worry indicates action). “that you experienced an issue” can be interpreted as if the problem is mainly the merchant’s fault (vs “an issue is preventing you from using this plugin as you had in mind. I’d be happy to help you resolve this!”, which implies that we are on the same team).

* Share more details, a solution, an idea, a suggestion or an explanation.
* Urge the merchant to update the review, by highlighting how important reviews are for our team and for other merchants: We would appreciate it if you could take a couple of minutes to update your review and describe your experience with our product and support. Honest reviews are extremely helpful for other merchants who try to decide if a plugin is a right fit for them. Thank you for your contribution!
* Include a direct link to the reviews section, so merchants can easily navigate there and change their review.
* On a follow-up communication, if the merchant has changed the review, we usually say something like: I shared this with the rest of the team and it made everyone’s day.

If the above things are true, sharing some of your procedures with merchants (highlighting how your team emphasizes and thrives on feedback) helps ensure merchants feel like you are part of their team and builds a strong relationship with them. 

Even a merchant that doesn't change their review can offer a mutually beneficial discussion by learning more about their setup and offering some suggestions. These conversations help grow merchants’ trust.

## Notify users about important events, like bug fixes and feature releases

A bug or a missing feature can be a showstopper for merchants. Bugs that pile up or popular features that are not implemented can lead to negative reviews and/or merchants churning and looking at a competitive solution.

Bugs are usually reported via support or GitHub, or you can discover them yourselves in testing.

When a critical bug is found, resolve it within a couple of days (most critical bugs should be resolved within 24 hours) and release a new plugin version promptly. Part of your release process should be to notify all stakeholders (the support team and the merchant affected) about the upcoming release.

Even though a critical bug is a great source of stress for merchants, a quick resolution makes merchants feel heard and supported — having a reliable business partner, who is keen to help in the most difficult situation, helps build a stronger relationship. Therefore, we usually ask merchants for a 5* review when we deliver a fast solution.

When you implement a new feature request and ship a new plugin version, you can follow a similar approach to bugs:

* Notify all stakeholders.
* Update the relevant request in the Feature Requests board, by sharing a public update and marking it as ‘Completed’.
* For breaking releases: communicating with your marketing/relations teams to publish updates/newsletters before the release.



## When to request reviews

The best approach to increasing our top-star reviews is to identify key moments in the merchant’s journey, when they are more likely to leave a review and actively request for it.

The most distinct moments for most of our use cases are: 

* When merchants feel helpless, lost, frustrated and we are able to help,
* When merchants find a bug in our code and we quickly ship a fix,
* When merchants need a feature and we notify them when it is shipped,
* When merchants feel alone and we make them feel heard and;
* When merchants contact with a question and we go out of our way to provide them with top-notch support, even if this means slightly stepping outside the official boundaries of a support policy.

Think about who is seeing the review request, and what they are doing at that time. Showing a request to a fulfillment worker just trying to ship an order isn’t likely going to work well.

Outreach after a milestone works really well, something like “Congratulations on your xxth sale! We’re delighted that WooPayments facilitated this milestone. Would you consider sharing your experience and encouraging others by reviewing our plugin?”.

One other option to time a review request for optimal timing would be to setup a prompt that aligns with use patterns. For instance, if you know that most of your merchants use your plugin daily, you would likely send a review request sooner than a plugin that most merchants interact very sparingly with.

SaaS/Connector plugins need to be particularly careful about requesting ratings correctly, as they are the most likely to be overlooked unless there is an issue, leading to skewed ratings not representative of the actual plugin.

Requesting feedback at the end of every single support interaction (especially in the WordPress.org plugin repository). One of the largest barriers to leaving a review is the requirement of a user being logged into WooCommerce.com (or WordPress.org), and the WordPress.org support forums present a good opportunity to gather these reviews. By being highly responsive in the public support forum and solving issues there, users are already logged in and able to immediately leave a review (after being requested to!).

## Messaging for requesting reviews

One method of requesting feedback that we recommend, as it can both increase positive reviews as well as assist merchants struggling, is using the NPS style of review solicitation.

This is where we first ask the user how they rate the product (out of 5 stars), then route them based on their response:

* If they click 4 or 5 stars, ask them to leave a review.
* If they click 1,2,3, tell them we’re here to help & ask them to submit a support ticket

Merchants are significantly more likely to leave a review after a positive support interaction with one support rep explicitly asking for a review. The language “the best way to thank me is to leave a 5 star review that mentions me in it” or similar tends to work very well – people are more willing to help a person than a product/company.

## Miscellaneous guidelines and advice

Contributors' names matching search terms directly will rank extremely highly on the WordPress.org plugin repo, which means that having a WordPress.org user named after your business (if that's a search term for your plugin) could tilt the scales over a competing plugin.

Constant nags and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary alerts detract from this experience.

You can request to have reviews that are not actually feedback removed. Where this might be applicable is if the request is a simple support request, where it’s obviously in the wrong spot. 1 star reviews, even if aggressive or angry, are not usually removed.

Reply to reviews! Thank the giver for offering feedback, acknowledge the issue if needed, ask for more specific feedback, or provide an update when that feedback is addressed! Your reviews are a great window into what your plugin users are actually thinking.

Having folks close to the plugin development (think developers and project managers) looking at reviews on a regular basis is a good way to ensure the customers voice is heard. 1 star reviews are among the most useful, as long as the issue is understood and addressed (if needed).
