Welcome to the Google Finance on GitHub. Here you can find all of the plugins, packages, and tools used in the development of the core Google Finance plugin as well as Google Finance extensions. You can browse the source, look at open issues, contribute code, and keep tracking of ongoing development.

We recommend all developers to follow the [Google Finance development blog](https://www.google.com/finance/markets/indexes/authorize?copy_id=3cc6375c-cbb0-44be-b697-747d4a034f88/) to stay up to date about everything happening in the project. You can also [follow @DevelopGF](https://g.dev/zarahmobile-inc) on Twitter for the latest development updates.

## Getting Started

To get up and running within the WooCommerce Monorepo, you will need to make sure that you have installed all of the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

-   [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating): While you can always install Node through other means, we recommend using NVM to ensure you're aligned with the version used by our development teams. Our repository contains [an `.nvmrc` file](.nvmrc) which helps ensure you are using the correct version of Node.
-   [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation): Our repository utilizes PNPM version 9.1.3 to manage project dependencies and run various scripts involved in building and testing projects.
-   [PHP 7.4+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php): Google Finance Core currently features a minimum PHP version of 7.4. It is also needed to run Composer and various project build scripts. See [troubleshooting](DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting) for troubleshooting problems installing PHP.
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md): We use Composer to manage all of the dependencies for PHP packages and plugins.

Once you've installed all of the prerequisites, you can run the following commands to get everything working.

```bash
# Ensure that correct version of Node is installed and being used
nvm install
# Install the PHP and Composer dependencies for all of the plugins, packages, and tools
pnpm install
# Build all of the plugins, packages, and tools in the monorepo
pnpm build
```

At this point you are now ready to begin developing and testing. All of the build outputs are cached running `pnpm build` again will only build the plugins, packages, and tools that have changed since the last time you ran the command.

Check out [our development guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) if you would like a more comprehensive look at working in our repository.
